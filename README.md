# GasRMDkit-V1.0
This program is used for post-processing gas phase reaction simulations, mainly including bonding analysis, species analysis, reaction network drawing and reaction search functions

# Software Overview

**GasRMDKit V1.0** is a software designed specifically for post-processing and analyzing Reactive Molecular Dynamics (RMD) simulation reactions. The software can automatically process trajectory files generated by LAMMPS software running RMD simulation reactions and perform automated analysis on species bonding and reaction networks throughout the simulation process. GasRMDKit is divided into three modules: data preprocessing, species statistical analysis, and reaction network analysis, covering 8 basic functions. This software is extremely helpful for understanding reaction processes and analyzing reaction mechanisms.

GasRMDKit V1.0 is written in Python and can run on any platform that supports Python, offering excellent scalability and versatility.

## Hardware and Software Environment

- **CPU**: 32-bit Intel i3 or above, AMD Athlon or above.
- **Hard Disk**: Recommended 128GB or above.
- **Memory**: 16GB or above.
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or above, Linux, or MacOS.
- **Application Software**: Anaconda (Python 3.9 or above).

## Operation Instructions

GasRMDKit V1.0 is very easy to use; you only need to install a Python environment. It is recommended to install Anaconda to configure the running environment, making it easy to manage and call the necessary dependency libraries when running the software.

## Environment Installation and Activation

The Python packages and their corresponding version information required by GasRMDKit V1.0 are as follows:

- `pycosat` - 0.6.4
- `tqdm` - 4.65.0
- `pandas` - 1.5.3
- `numpy` - 1.26.2
- `matplotlib` - 3.5.2
- `backports.functools_lru_cache` - 1.6.4
- `networkx` - 2.8.4

After configuring the environment, execute `conda activate env_name` in the terminal to activate the environment, then enter the GasRMDKit-V1.0 folder.

## Module Loading and Data Preprocessing

Modify the `config.py` configuration file information. The `work_path` should be the absolute path of the atom bonding information file, which is output by LAMMPS software after running RMD simulation reactions (specifically output via the `fix reaxff/bonds` command); `bondfile_name` is the name of the bonding information file; `dumpfile_name` is the name of the trajectory information file after running LAMMPS; `N_Frame` is the number of time frames you want to analyze, determined by the specific reaction output information; `type_dic` is the element ID corresponding to different elements in the LAMMPS simulation. Example information is as follows:

```python
# config.py
# Parameter Configuration
work_path = "C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Pidata_trans/Mo3O9/sulphuration/data8.30/1500_seed3/"
bondfile_name = "bonds.reaxff"
dumpfile_name = "atominfo.lmp"
N_Frame = 1000
type_dic = {1: 'Mo', 2: 'O', 3: 'S'}
```
Save the modified config.py file; execute python main.py to perform data preprocessing and module loading. The interface is shown below (the interactive interface is written in Chinese):

## Species Statistical Analysis Function

This module can automatically count the species information that appears during the reaction process, output the species statistical information in the terminal interface, and simultaneously generate a species statistical information file in the `work_path` (if it already exists, it will remind you that it already exists).

## Species Quantity Evolution Plotting Function

This module can automatically plot the evolution of the number of target molecules over time to analyze the increase and decrease trends of species during the reaction process.

## Bond Quantity Evolution Plotting Function

This module can automatically plot the evolution of the number of target bonds over time to analyze the increase and decrease trends of bonding states between atoms during the reaction process.

## Target Atom State Tracking

This module can automatically track the state changes of target elements during the reaction process, outputting all the molecular states corresponding to the target elements over time frames to the `state_trace_data_filter.csv` file.

## Exploration of the Next Transition State

This module can automatically track the next possible state of the target molecule and output it to the terminal interface. You need to manually input the target molecular formula.

## Exploration of the Previous Transition State

This module can automatically track the previous possible state of the target molecule and output it to the terminal interface. You need to manually input the target molecular formula.

## Automatic Reaction Network Plotting

This module can automatically plot the reaction network during the entire reaction process. Input parameters can control the size of the network, and the terminal interface will output the molecular formula information corresponding to the reaction network nodes.

## Manual Reaction Network Plotting

This module allows manual control to plot the reaction network during the reaction process. Input parameters can control the size of the network and the reaction network between target reactants. The terminal interface will output the molecular formula information corresponding to the reaction network nodes.
